Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]

Output: 9


Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]

Output: 3


 
Constraints:


	0 <= nums.length <= 105
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
